/**
 * Project planning:
 * 
 * Questions to ask yourself before writing any code:
 * 
 * - What are the main containers of elements I need
 *   in this app?
 * 
 * 
 * - What values will need to be saved in state vs.
 *   what values can be derived from the state?
 * 
 * 
 * - How will the user interact with the app? What
 *   events do I need to handle?
 *

/**
 * Goal: Build out the main parts of our app
 * 
 * Challenge: 
 * 1. Save a "currentWord" in state. Initialize as "react".
 * 2. Map over the letters of the word (you'll need to turn 
 *    the string into an array of letters first) and display
 *    each one as a <span>. Capitalize the letters when
 *    displaying them.
 * 3. Style to look like the design. You can get the underline 
 *    effect on the box using `border-bottom`.
